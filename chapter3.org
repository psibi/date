* Time Zones

** What is a Time Zone

- A Time Zone is a Geographic Region.
  - Follows the same local clock.
  - Abides by the same set of timekeeping rules.
  - Usually determined by Law.
- A Time Zone is NOT an offset.
  - Offsets are only a part of a time zone.
  - More than one offset might apply, at different parts of the year.
- Defines the configuration of local clocks.
  - Covers all time within the region.
- Has a common or legal name. Eg: IST
- Has a standard offset from UTC.
- Includes Daylight Saving Time Rules.
  - Transition Date patterns.
  - Transition Times
  - Transition Amount (1 hour etc)
- Includes History of Changes (like git!)
  - DST Rules
  - Offsets
  - Alignments: that occur by each time zone transitioning by a
    fractional amount to line up with UTC. (Alignments are offset
    changes but done with the intention of aligning with UTC)
- Time Zones are set by Governments.
  - Expect Suprises and Oddities.
  - Changes Occur Often
- Reason for Time Zone Changes
  - Trade/Commerce
  - Religious Observations

** Time Zone Fallacies

The below mentioned points are false. Reasoning is explained on why
they are false:

- Time zone is a numeric offset from UTC.
  - Many time zones share offsets.
  - Even though some time zones may carry the same offset at some
    point, the way they use that offset is very different. So a time
    zone is much more than simply being a numeric offset from UTC.
- Time zone names and abbreviations are unique.
  - Counterexample: IST
    - Israel Stanard Time - UTC+02:00
    - India Standard Time - UTC+05:300
    - Irish Standard Time - UTC+01:00
- Local people know their time zone and how to abbreviate it.
  - Counterexample: Hawaii
    - According to Government: HAST - Hawaii Aleutian Stanard Time
    - According to People: HST - Hawaiian Stanard Time
- An entire state follows the same rules for daylight saving times
  - Counterexample: Part of Arizona
- Outside of USA, if I know what country a person is in, I can
  determine their time zone.
  - Counterexample: Brazil
- Time zones will never change, so I only have to think about them
  when I first build my application.
  - Recommendation:
    - Do not assume UTC offset of future calender dates.
    - Keep your Time Zone Data updated.
    - Use a Time Zone Database.
- There can only be two daylight saving time transitions in any given
  year.
  Counterexample: Egypt

** The IANA Time Zone Database

- IANA: Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
- Known by sereral names
  - IANA
  - Olson
  - TZDB
  - TZ
  - ZoneInfo
- Identifier Format: Area/Location
  - Examples:
    - America/New_York
    - America/Indiana/Knox
- Historical accurancy at least since 1970.
- Data in this database doesn't come from IANA, but it's community
  maintained. It's frequently updated.

** Microsoft Time Zone Database

- Built in to Windows operating system.
- Maintained by Microsoft, not a stanard body or community.
- Zones are sometimes poorly defined.
- Very limited historical data.
- Strange Zone Identifiers.
- Recommendation: Avoid this and use IANA database

** The Unicode CLDR

- Not a time zone database.
- Source of data for localized translations.
  - Time Zone Names
  - Dates, Times, Numbers, Currency and much more.
- Contains "MetaZones"
  - Groups of Time Zones that can span countries.
- Contains Translations of Windows Zones to IANA Zones.

** Rails Time Zones

- Ruby on Rails has it's own time zones.
- Uses the same IANA time zone database.
- Limited subset of 146 "meaningful" zones.
  - Poorly defined criteria

** POSIX Time Zones

- POSIX = Portable Operating System Interface
- You'll see POSIX time zones in C/C++ applications.
- Examples:
  - PST8PDT: In Pacific Stanard time the offset is 8 and when daylight
    saving time occurs, we will call it as Pacific Daylight time.
  - EST5EDT4,M3.2.0/02:00,M11.1.0/02:00
- Cryptic, Error Prone
- Limited to 2 transitions per year
- Contains only current rules
- Recommendation: Do not use. Treat as deprecated.
- GNU C library contains many time zone functions that will work with
  IANA database.
- Other alternatives: ICU4C
- Do not use Boost time zone APIs.
