* Date and Time Fundamentals

* The Human Problem

- Clocks and calendars are human devices.
- Humans tend to think about time locally.
- Julius Caesar created [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar][Julian Calender]].
- Pope Gergory XIII created [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar][Gergorian calender]].
  - This is the most commonly used calender in the world.
  - Changes made to how leap years are determined.
  - Ommitted 10 days from October. So basically October 5th, 1582
    didn't exist. More details in the wikipedia page.
- Other calenders: Hebrew, Buddhism, Islamic etc.
- ISO-8601 - International Standards for Date and Time.
  - This is what most computer systems follow.
  - It also defines the calender system as Proleptic Gregorian
    Calender. It's also called as ISO calender.

* Universal Time

- Single global point of reference. No Time Zones.
- Synchronized via Network Time Protocol (NTP)
- The first basis for a Universal time was GMT or Greenwich Mean Time.
  - Since 1847.
- UTC = Coordinated Universal Time
  - Happened in 1972
  - Preferred modern reference point
- Primary difference between UTC and GMT:
  - GMT has a civil definition.
  - UTC has scientific definition. UTC also uses atomic clocks.
- UTC also has leap seconds.
  - These are one second periods that are added to the time scale to
    keep it perfectly in sync with another time scale called UT1.
- Both UTC and UT1 are intended to stay in sync with earth's rotation.
  - UTC is measured by atomic clocks.
  - UT1 is measured by observing astronomical phenomenon.
  - Because they aren't always in sync, we get leap seconds.

- GMT or UTC ?
  - There isn't much difference between then in modern times.
  - In modern times, GMT is kept perfectly in sync with UTC. And hence
    the difference between them doesn't matter.
- Use UTC when:
  - As a timekeeping system
  - As the reference point for a time zone offset. (UTC-07:00)
- Use GMT:
  - As part of the UK's time zone (GMT/BST)
  - Civil purpose

* Daylight Saving Time

- Government mandated clock adjustments.
- Usually the clock is advanced forward by an hour in the spring, and
  is retracted backwards by an hour in the fall.
- Also known as "Summer time".
- Does not occur in every time zone.
- Not applied the same way in every year. There is no guarantee that
  it's going to be the same in future years.

** Spring Forward Transition

- Local time advances forward
  - Usually by 1 hour

** Fall Back Transition

- Local time rewinds backwards
  - Usually by 1 hour
