* Context Matter

- In software, make sure to preserve context using better types.
- Some context for date and time:
  - UTC for DateTime
  - DateTimeOffset instead of storing local time.

* Formatting

- Use 4 digit year in formatting to avoid confusion.
- ISO-8601 standard provides format for unambiguos
  interpretation. (MM/DD/YY vs DD/MM/YY)
- ISO-8601 recommendation
  - Simple Format (YYYY-MM-DD)

* Scope

- Date and Time
  - Example: ~2013-12-31 22:00:00~
  - Suitable for event time. Eg: Application log, Date of comment
- Date
  - Example: ~2013-12-31~
  - Suitable for just dates. Eg: Birthdate
- Time Of Day
  - Example: ~10:00:00 PM~
  - AM/PM is called meridiem. It's a latin word meaning midday.
  - AM stands for ante meridiem or before midday.
  - PM stands for post meridiem or after midday.
  - Use cases: Businss hours
- Elapsed Time
  - Example: 33 hours, 15 minutes etc.
  - Use case: Duration of Activity.
- Imperfect Time Period
  - Example: 1 year, 3 months, 10 days etc.
  - Use case: Estimate, Scheduling

* Perspective

- Unspecified Perspective
  - Example ~2013-12-31 22:00:00~
  - Could be local time.
- Universal Perspective
  - Example ~2013-12-31 16:00:00 UTC~
  - Instead of ~UTC~ above, it's also specified as ~GMT~ or marked by
    a letter ~Z~ which stands for Zulu time. Zulu time is just a
    military way of specifying GMT.
  - It's completely unambiguos. Represents a fixed moment of time
    regardless of time zones.
- Local Perspective (Sibi: Todo - Go through the video again)
  - By Offset (~2013-12-31 22:00:00 -06:00~)
  - By Time Zone (~2013-12-31 22:00:00 Central~)
  - By Time Zone Segment (~2013-12-31 22:00:00 CST~)
- By Time Zone & Offset
  - Example ~2013-12-31 22:00:00 -06:00 Central~
